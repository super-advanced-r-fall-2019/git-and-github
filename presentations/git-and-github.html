# What is Git?

--

- A system for version control of a directory

  - Stored as a series of snapshots (commits)
  - Reload and restart from each snapshot
![](https://blog.devmountain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Gitvs.Github-1b-750x322.jpg)

???
Like saving at and loaing from checkpoints in a video game.

It becomes a repository when there's version control
--

- Free and open source

# Git

&lt;img src="https://git-scm.com/images/logo@2x.png" width="50%" /&gt;

1. Local version control

1. From the command line or used with third party GUIs

&lt;img src="https://git-scm.com/images/logo@2x.png" width="50%" /&gt;

Keep track of your code over time

Go back to older versions of your repository

# Bottom line:
If (when) you screw your code up at some point, Git and Github will be there for you to help you find out when and where that happened.

# Ways to Git

All Git commands can be executed in the command line- Command Prompt, Terminal.

There are also many different user interfaces for managing Git repositories.

- Dan's favourite: [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)


- From the makers of Sublime Text: [SublimeMerge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/)


- From the developers of Github: [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)

# Exercise: Getting set up

---
class: inverse

# Getting set up

1. Open up a command window

  - Windows users: type "cmd" into your search bar
  - Mac users: type "terminal" into Spotlight
  - Linux users: you probably should know how to do this already

--

1. `git --version`
  - To check that you have installed Git

--

1. `git config --list`
  - To look at your global Git configuration variables
  
--
  
1. `git config --global user.name "Lee Qi" `
  - Set user name (not the same as your Github username; this is Git!)
  
1. `git config --global user.email "leeqi@uw.edu"`
  - Set email address (important in tracking your commit history!)
  
???
Commits are linked to these, and that's how git and Github track your commits over time

# How to Git

&lt;img src="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/areas.png" width="90%" /&gt;

---
# How to Git (on your local machine)

--

1. Create a directory

--

1. Initialise repository: `git init`

--

1. Make changes

--

1. Stage changes: `git add` and/or `git rm`

--

1. Commit changes: `git commit -m "a very informative commit message"`

.center[
&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/UBVE6ZGaZDX7a/giphy.gif" width="30%" /&gt;
]
---

# How to Git (with a remote repository)

1. Clone a repository from a remote: `git clone`
  - You can also use `git init` but it gets more complicated setting up the remote

--

1. Make changes

--

1. ***Pull*** any changes from your collaborators: `git pull` (shortcut combining `git fetch` and `git merge`)

--

1. Stage changes: `git add` and/or `git rm`

1. Commit changes: `git commit -m "a very informative commit message"`

--

1. ***Push*** your changes to the remote: `git push`

---

# How to Git

### Your Mantra:

&gt; Stage, commit, pull, push!

---
class: middle

# `git clone`
Clones an existing repository from a remote connection onto your local directory.

background-size: 450px
background-position: 50% 90%

## Why `clone`? Why not just download the .zip file?

--

Sets directory up as a repository (i.e., with version history)

Sets up link to remote git repository (`git clone`)

Tracks your local changes and compares to the remote connection (`git status`)

Pull easily to incorporate updates (`git pull`)

```
cd &lt;directory-you-want-the-repo-in&gt;
git clone https://github.com/super-advanced-r-fall-2019/git-and-github.git
```
--

### From RStudio:

1. New Project
1. Version control
1. Git
1. Repository URL: https://github.com/super-advanced-r-fall-2019/git-and-github.git

# `.gitignore`

One file to rule them all - applies to every clone of the repository

Specifies files and diretories to ignore (intentionally untrack)

--

Each line specifies a pattern
- `*` matches anything but a `/`
- `!` excludes files from a specified pattern
- Visit [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) and [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore) for ways to specify patterns

--

Can also set global patterns to ignore as a configuration variable `core.excludesFile`

--

***NOTE***: Files already tracked by Git are not affected.
- To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked, `git rm --cached` will do the trick.

# `.gitignore`

# `git pull`

Shortcut combining `git fetch` and `git merge`.

&lt;img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3orieOjpRtscDxPKQo/giphy.gif" width="50%" /&gt;

--

`git fetch`: downloads changes from the remote repository 

???
Doesn't touch your working tree; gives you chance to look at what you're dealing with before actually merging
--

`git merge`: merges those changes with your local copy.

# Creating a repository from scratch

1. Create a new directory on your computer

git init               # Initialise the repo
ls -a                  # List all the files in the repo
```
--

1. Create a `.gitignore`

--

1. Create a `README.md`

???
Local version control
--

# OR create one on Github

... and clone it to your computer.

???
Automatically sets up the remote link

# `git add`

Stages tracked modified files for committing.

--

# `git rm`

Removes a tracked file from the Git index and from the working directory.

--

# `git status`

View status of your repo - which files are in what state.
---

# On staging files
- Stage / unstage changes selectively (`git add/rm &lt;filename&gt;`; recommended) or

- Stage all at once (`git add/rm -a`; my lazy method)

--

- Check the status  with `git status` on the command line, or with a GUI

--
- `git diff &lt;filename&gt;` can show unstaged changes of a file, but can get unwieldy

### Person 1:
  - Navigate to your newly-created Github repository on your internet browser

# Exercise: Making and Staging Changes
--

1. Check the status of the repository
  - `git status`

--

1. Create a file in the repository 

  - e.g., an R script that prints: `Hello, World!`
  - Person A and Person 1 each saves this files under a different name
  
--

1. Check the status of the repository

--

1. Stage your change
  - `git add -a` or `git add &lt;name-of-R-file&gt;`
  
--

1. Check the status of the repository again - what's changed?

--

### Bonus:
How do we unstage changes without deleting the file?

From [happygitwithr](https://happygitwithr.com/git-branches.html)

In this conflict, the lines between &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:my-file.R and ====== are the content from the branch you are currently on. The lines between ======= and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; issue-5:my-file.R are from the feature branch we are merging. 

To resolve the conflict, edit this section until it reflects the state you want in the merged result. Pick one version or the other or create a hybrid. Also remove the conflict markers &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, ====== and &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;.

# Merge Conflicts

.pull-left[
### When changes happen on two different copies of the repo and are directed to the same remote

They are going to happen

You will have to deal with it

Almost definitely by hand

Easier with a GUI

Helps if you `pull` / `commit` / `push` often
]
---

# Dealing with Merge Conflicts

When you `pull`, Git will automatically try and merge files that have conflicts.

Might be easier to go into a GUI and manually sort through the changes
- Some GUIs have more intuitive interfaces than others

1. Make more changes to your branch

1. Go back to `master` and make changes

1. Go back to your branch and [rebase](https://hackernoon.com/git-merge-vs-rebase-whats-the-diff-76413c117333) from `master`

1. Merge rebased branch back into `master`

### Forking

1. Creates a copy of the repository on Github

1. You have push privileges to your forked repository

1. You can create a Pull Request for the owner of the original repository to review your changes and merge them into the original repository

# Fun stuff to look into

Github
- Issues
- Releases
- Projects

Git
- `git tag`
- `git bisect`

--

## Things to keep in mind
- Deleting files doesn't remove from Github necessarily
- Repos can get unwieldy over time
  - Try not to store anything other than code to keep it light
  - Github Releases is a cool feature that could help
