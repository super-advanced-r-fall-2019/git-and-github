# What is Git?

--

- A system for version control of a directory

  - Stored as a series of snapshots (commits)
  - Reload and restart from each snapshot
![](https://blog.devmountain.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Gitvs.Github-1b-750x322.jpg)

???
Like saving at and loaing from checkpoints in a video game.

It becomes a repository when there's version control
--

- Free and open source

# Ways to Git

All Git commands can be executed in the command line- Command Prompt, Terminal.

There are also many different user interfaces for managing Git repositories.

- Dan's favourite: [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)


- From the makers of Sublime Text: [SublimeMerge](https://www.sublimemerge.com/)


- From the developers of Github: [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

- [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/)

class: inverse

# Getting set up

1. Open up a command window

  - Windows users: type "cmd" into your search bar
  - Mac users: type "terminal" into Spotlight
  - Linux users: you probably should know how to do this already

--

1. `git --version`
  - To check that you have installed Git

--

1. `git config --list`
  - To look at your global Git configuration variables
  
--
  
1. `git config --global user.name "Lee Qi" `
  - Set user name (not the same as your Github username; this is Git!)
  
1. `git config --global user.email "leeqi@uw.edu"`
  - Set email address (important in tracking your commit history!)
  
???
Commits are linked to these, and that's how git and Github track your commits over time

# How to Git


### Your Mantra:

> Commit, pull, push!

---

# How to Git (on your local machine)

--

1. Create a directory

--

1. Initialise repository: `git init`

--

1. Make changes

--

1. Stage changes: `git add` and/or `git rm`

--

1. Commit changes: `git commit -m "a very informative commit message"`

.center[
```{r out.width = '30%'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/UBVE6ZGaZDX7a/giphy.gif")
```
]
---

# How to Git (with a remote repository)

1. Clone a repository from a remote: `git clone`
  - You can also use `git init` but it gets more complicated setting up the remote

--

1. Make changes

--

1. ***Pull*** any changes from your collaborators: `git pull` (shortcut combining `git fetch` and `git merge`)

--

1. Stage changes: `git add` and/or `git rm`

1. Commit changes: `git commit -m "a very informative commit message"`

--

1. ***Push*** your changes to the remote: `git push`

--

# `git clone`
Clones an existing repository from a remote connection onto your local directory.

## Why `clone`? Why not just download the .zip file?

--

Sets directory up as a repository (i.e., with version history)

Sets up link to remote git repository (`git clone`)

Tracks your local changes and compares to the remote connection (`git status`)

Pull easily to incorporate updates (`git pull`)

# `.gitignore`

One file to rule them all - applies to every clone of the repository

Specifies files and diretories to ignore (intentionally untrack)

--

Each line specifies a pattern
- `*` matches anything but a `/`
- `!` excludes files from a specified pattern
- Visit [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) and [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore) for ways to specify patterns

--

Can also set global patterns to ignore as a configuration variable `core.excludesFile`

--

***NOTE***: Files already tracked by Git are not affected.
- To stop tracking a file that is currently tracked, `git rm --cached` will do the trick.

`git fetch`: downloads changes from the remote repository

Doesn't touch your working tree; gives you chance to look at what you're dealing with before actually merging

1. Create a `.gitignore`

# OR create one on Github

# `git add`

--

# `git rm`

Removes a tracked file from the Git index and from the working directory.

--

# `git status`

View status of your repo - which files are in what state.
---

# On staging files
- Stage / unstage changes selectively (`git add/rm <filename>`; recommended) or

- Stage all at once (`git add/rm -a`; my lazy method)

--

- Check the status  with `git status` on the command line, or with a GUI

--
- `git diff <filename>` can show unstaged changes of a file, but can get unwieldy

# Exercise: Making and Staging Changes
--

1. Check the status of the repository
  - `git status`

--

1. Create a file in the repository 

  - e.g., an R script that prints: `Hello, World!`
  - Person A and Person 1 each saves this files under a different name
  
--

1. Check the status of the repository

--

1. Stage your change
  - `git add -a` or `git add <name-of-R-file>`
  
--

1. Check the status of the repository again - what's changed?

# Dealing with Merge Conflicts

When you `pull`, Git will automatically try and merge files that have conflicts.

Might be easier to go into a GUI and manually sort through the changes

Github
- Issues
- Releases
- Projects

Git
- `git tag`
- `git bisect`

## Things to keep in mind
- Deleting files doesn't remove from Github necessarily
- Repos can get unwieldy over time
  - Try not to store anything other than code to keep it light
  - Github Releases is a cool feature that could help
